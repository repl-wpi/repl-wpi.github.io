      <h3>Charlie Roberts</h3>
      <p>
      <a href="https://charlie-roberts.com">Charlie</a> directs the REPL.
      In his research he examines the design of digital systems for creative
      expression. His performance practice currently focuses on <em>live coding</em>,
      where performers write code to create audiovisual art and project their code
      to audiences. He has performed and presented his research across the US, Europe,
      and Asia.
